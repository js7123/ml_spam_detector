# ml_spam_detector
Machine Leaning-enabled Spam Detector web app using Django and Scikit-Learn

## Spam Detector Sample Test Cases:

### Test Case #1 : Spam
For this test case we use the sample sentence: 'Win 50 pounds receive a membership reward prize'.
This sentence is composed of strings that the Scikit-learn ML model identifies as belonging to a spam message. 
The image below shows the spam detector web app predicts the input sentence is spam.

### Test Case #2 : Not Spam

In this case we use the sample sentence: 'Hello John! Will you be interested in winning a free trip?'.
This sentence does not include any strings that the Scikit-learn ML model identifies as belonging to a spam message. 
The image below shows the spam detector web app predicts that input sentence input is 'ham' (i.e. not spam).
